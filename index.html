  <title>vivid moment(s) today</title>
  <p>this feels like a physical weight and its heavy. why does a website demand to be continued, why can they not exist only to incapsulate a moment. I say as I go add this to the list of things i need to upload?</p>

    <p>The bathroom 
Metro vs the bus 
Couldnt figure out google maps 
Found another person going through a lake went
The ground was awful and my docs were eating my heels even more
Looked at the lake 
Walked while it bit me 
Student of color lounge – dindt find the card in my pocket, finding it in the bag while putting it on the side table. They eyes were felt too much 
Went through the stairs hoping for something idk less eyes 
Went to the bathroom and collapsed
Was were overstimulated with the jacket and the bag that was too full and too open and too close to my shoulder 
Took off my doc and my socks 
Got irritated and it seemed like a lot 
Thought about whether to put the tights over or under the socks 
Decided after a lot of brainpower insider made senese 
Did that, I had cut the front of the tights with yellow kitchen scissors before i left
Remember thinkking why i put up with this amount of discomfort since i got the tights in whitman
Put it on, the insoles were awful and i could feel the end too close to where it was eating my foot earlier 
Put them in the bag, remember thinking what if someone sees they are inside my bag.
(while i write this, had to mute the music because my tummy is grumbling and i was know if other people can hear it) 
Took them off, put the shoes on. I think i had to undo the laces on the right foot because it was too tights and the zipper was not enough 
Am i stressign myself out by writing this. Am i making myself worse or following the intensity 
I remember sitting there for a really long time. I think the lights turned off and i sat in the dark. I think the dark made it better. And then i remember breathing and waving both my hands above my head as if to indicate i was ready. .</p>

    <p class="label"><b>vivid</b></p> 
                  <p>an open doc is to me what importance is to a neurotypical </p>
                  <p> why does it feel like i need to optimise the code? That is not what this is </p>
                  <p> you see what you know.applies well to travel </p>
                  <p> at what point do you hang over your agency to another person, i seem to running everything good into a shithole that i source from my rottenness </p>
                  <p> i wwant to make a research journal where poeple can leave comments like google docs </p>
                  <p> the sky looked so sinister. it was the shade of expensive dark cyan with a blue somewhere between dark cornflower blue and light blue. somebody sitting on/near(?) crates was screaming "fuck" really loudly. I found that comforting </p>
                  <p> loving people who love things openly and wildly is very easy </p>
                  <p> ah this feeling. bare face. tenderness and care in beautiful eyes. comfort in bodies. liking where we both stand. unmaking with other people. the light reflecting perfectly from the water. i want to keep loving this. I want leaving to feel uneasy for once.</p>
    <b>time: late night, moment: room, feel: light, hopeful, cared for</b>
      <p>i love the pushing things off till the name minute, the pressure makes me feel calm</p>
      <p>do we ever think about our breathing as the regulation source?, haha i think thats called meditation</p>
      <p> do you think we will remember this? maybe. we should start a startup. it doesnt have to make any money. but yk say we have a startup so we can always find an excuse to see each other</p>
      <p> its just i couldnt tell if it was because i was fun or we were</p>
      <p> i think i would wanna make movies. ones that confirm people. i like writing but I think its just one of those things you care too much about and ruin it because you hold it too tight and close. i might have an easier time if i direct</p>
      <p> missing people is an interesting Other now. its not that i don't miss them, its just i drift apart pretty far and fast and in that distance, I understand why its necessary, so im not sure </p>
      <p> i dont know i make things because i like myself a lot while doing it. I make things to understand what im made of

    <p class="label"><b>anything else</b></p>
    <p> i am so gleefully looking forward to march</p>
    <h1> MARCH <3 </h1>
    <h3> 01 March 2025 </h3>
    <H4> i want to make work that confirms people who have been erased. I want want want to hold onto as much as I can before my erasure as a Kashmiri. I want to make art for the in-between, the contradictory, the erased. I want to make work for my parents. I want to create worlds that confirms them. I want to make a world into existence where they feel safe. Even if it exists just for them and i can never show them. i want to make worlds where they wouldn't have been robbed of play and home</H4>


      <h4>even when/if i find to form, I can never show them. i want to rip my heart out and show them without putting theirs in danger. is there a world where our hearts aren't surveilled? </h4>
  </div>

              <p> i was unbearable today but not consumed with the kind of general fear i had today. i watched trashy movies, listened to The Interview and hasan minhaj podcasts, slept, ate yogurt like icecream and finally started writing sitting on the floor on a pile of laundry  </p>
              <p> i think maybe they believed in me because as they said they saw themselves in me but maybe they kind enough to believe in everyone, it is a small school so they had the capacity to believe in everyone. </p>
              <p> the language that i am thinking with is more precise, so my perception of the what worlds i want to create is changed naturally. maybe i really can write myself into a life i want. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGWCqgIyrbM </p>
              <p>specificity negates judgment. that applies to the self as well</p>
              <p> i get glimpses of myself right before the deadlines. without them, i seem to be hurried</p>



    ----
              <p>this is a thought, i can have a different one</p>
